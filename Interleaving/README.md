# Programming Assignment 1
> These programs satisfy the questions presented in Programing Assignment 1. ClosestFinder.java uses a randomly
generated set of 30 plot points and calculates the distance between each point using brute force
algorithm, and then uses divide-and-conquer to determine the closest points. 'Main.java' is for part 2 of the assignment
and the subsequent '.java' files complement this project. MachineLibrary defines the finite state machines for DTM, Addition,
Subtraction, and multiplication. These results are output to the project folder. Pseudocode for part 1 is located in 'notes.txt' inside the
project folder.



## Installation



Windows:

Uses Java 8 JDK and Eclipse IDE

## Usage example

See results.txt for output of TM results
See result_closest.txt for output of closesfinder.java

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
NOTE: The multiplication Finite state machine only works with binary digits whom are separated by a single blank space on the tape.
The addition, subtraction, and DTM all work with any number of spaces between numbers. All operation-states must satisfy 'm>n' in order to compile and run correctly.

```
