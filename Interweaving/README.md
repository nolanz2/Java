# Interleaving Strings
> These programs checks interleaving of two strings within a third string. Main.java takes string X, Y, and S and determines if X and Y are interleaving strings of S. The user inputs values 
for strings X, Y and S. Program returns true if S contains solely repititions of either X, Y, or both X and Y in any order. A repitition is defined as:. Given a string x consisting of 0s and 1s, we 
write x^k to denote k copies of x concatenated together. We say that string x′ is a repetition of x if it is a prefix of x^k for some number k. So 1011 would be a repitition of 101, for example.
Sample outputs can be found in the project folder within 'sample_output.txt'. Pseudocode for part 1 is located in 'algorithm.txt' inside the project folder.



## Installation



Windows:

Uses Java 8 JDK and Eclipse IDE

## Usage example

See sample_output.txt for sample output of results

## Development setup


```sh
NOTE: The program allows for cases where string S is simply a repitition of either string X or Y. String S does not need to contain segments of both Y and X.

```
