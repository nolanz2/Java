# Quicksort and Median-of-three Quicksort
> These programs perform quicksort and median of three quicksort. QuickSort runs quicksort using a pivot based on the middle index, but can be switched to utilize a 
index[0] or index[length-1] pivot. MedianOfThreeQuickSort uses the same code for the QuickSort.java but chooses the pivot based on the median of three strategy. 
Both QuickSort and MedianOfThreeQuickSort implement a fixed array to sort but can be switched to utilize a random array or an already sorted array.



## Installation



Windows:

Uses Java 8 JDK and Eclipse IDE

## Usage example

See results.txt for output of QuickSort and MedianOfThreeQuickSort results

## Development setup


```sh
NOTE: To compare runtime of the two methods of quick sort, modify the array contents as needed. Utilizing getarray() will
allow generation of a random array of length 10. 

```
